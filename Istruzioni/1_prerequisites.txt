The package is not plug&play. You need to modify all the entities inside it. Then you need to create the packages folder in config and copy the Telegram_package folder into it and possibly also meteo_forecast.yaml for the weather sensors. To make Home Assistant see the yaml files, you need to have the following string in configuration.yaml:

homeassistant:
  # Packages folder #
  packages: !include_dir_named packages

and restart Home Assistant.
The prerequisite for this package to work is to have done the entire bot creation procedure with BotFather (see How to create a bot) and to have configured Telegram polling in the configuration.yaml.
For example:

telegram_bot:
  - platform: polling
    api_key: 5428613602:3k3olewszYm6-47G33s6fvfxC6GfUXasdfdY
    allowed_chat_ids:
      - 3175824532
      - 1673486287

The notify service is needed to send a notification directly to a particular chat.
to be clear this:

notify:
  - name: fabio_telegram
    platform: telegram
    chat_id: 3175824532
  - name: sergio_telegram
    platform: telegram
    chat_id: 1673486287

I used this service for tg_notifica_allarme automation

P.S. the api key and chad id are not real, they do not correspond to the truth.
They are placed randomly only for demonstration purposes.
