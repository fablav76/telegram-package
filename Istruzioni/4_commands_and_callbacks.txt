######################################### HOW DO COMMANDS AND CALLBACKS WORK? #############################################

Let's go back to the topic of commands and callbacks because they are essential to understanding automations
When we write in the Telegram chat /start or /video in Home Assistant, a telegram_command event is generated.
In the automation we insert as a trigger (WHEN section)

triggers:
- trigger: event
  event_type: telegram_command
  event_data:
    command: "/start"

and then the actions we want to be executed.

When instead we receive a message from Home Assistant, with notify or telegram_send_message, with an inline_keyboard,
and we click on one of these buttons, a telegram_callback type event is generated.
For example, if we click on the Lights button and we want something to happen, we need to create an automation with the following trigger:

triggers:
  - trigger: event
    event_type: telegram_callback
    event_data:
      data: "/lights"

and then the actions we want to be performed.
