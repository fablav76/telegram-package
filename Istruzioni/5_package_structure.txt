######################################### TELEGRAM PACKAGE ############################################

This package is divided into 2 folders:
the Automations folder and the Scripts folder.
In the Automations folder there are the automations,
which are executed when you execute the commands and callbacks.
In the Scripts folder there are the scripts that execute the menus
that are displayed in the chat.
So in general I followed this scheme
1) I type /luci on the chat
2) the tg_luci automation starts because there is a trigger with event_type: command corresponding to /luci
3) this trigger has id: luci
4) further down there are the actions, among these the one with id: luci
5) immediately below you can see the sequence of actions, the first is an action: script_tg_script_luci
which runs the tg_script_luci script
6) going to the tg_script_luci.yaml file we see that it is nothing more than a telegram_bot.send_message
with the lights menu and the inline_keyboard to go to the room submenus.

For callbacks it is the same thing.
1) I press the Living room button
2) the /living room callback starts which triggers the tg_luci automation (always the same)
but the id this time is living room
3) in the actions at the bottom under id: living room there is first a telegram_bot.delete_message
which deletes the lights menu and then the tg_script_luci_living room script
(it is always in the tg_script_luci.yaml file, but further down) which starts the next menu,
that is, the one relating to the living room lights.

I refer to the diagram 6_automations.txt and 7_scripts.txt for more information on their concatenation
